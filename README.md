# Data Access Examples in Python

This repository demonstrates three different ways to access data using various formats and access technologies. Each method is implemented in Python and highlights a common structure (JSON, CSV, HTML) along with its pros and cons.

## Files

- `data_access_examples.py`: Contains Python functions to:
  - Fetch JSON from a public API
  - Read a local CSV file
  - Scrape HTML from a webpage

## Requirements

Install dependencies using:

```bash
pip install requests pandas beautifulsoup4
```

## Usage

Run the script using:

```bash
python data_access_examples.py
```

Ensure that `sample.csv` exists in the same directory for the CSV function to work.
